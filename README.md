# Welcome to the icttiket_31oktober_undhari_ wiki!
This project is a content management system developed using native PHP. The application allows users to manage content by adding, editing, and deleting data through a simple and user-friendly interface. The application is designed to run on a local server using MAMP.

**Here's how you can run the project locally:**

- `git clone https://github.com/ridhoundhar/icttiket_31oktober_undhari_.git`

- Create a new database named `tiket` and import the database from the db file.

* For MAMP:
`$conn = mysqli_connect("localhost", "root", "root", "tiket");`
* For XAMPP:
`$conn = mysqli_connect("localhost", "root", "", "tiket");`
Make sure to update the database connection details based on your local setup.
